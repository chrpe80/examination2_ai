Sure! Here are five exercises involving dictionaries:

Exercise 1:
Write a Python program to create a dictionary with key-value pairs representing the names and ages of five people. Then, print the dictionary.

Exercise 2:
Write a Python program to merge two dictionaries into a new dictionary. If a key is common to both dictionaries, the value from the second dictionary should be used. Print the new dictionary.

Exercise 3:
Write a Python program to count the frequency of each character in a given string. Store the characters as keys and their frequencies as values in a dictionary. Print the dictionary.

Exercise 4:
Write a Python program to find the key with the maximum value in a dictionary. Print the key.

Exercise 5:
Write a Python program to remove a key-value pair from a dictionary. Prompt the user to enter a key, and if the key exists in the dictionary, remove the corresponding key-value pair. Print the updated dictionary.

I hope these exercises help you practice working with dictionaries in Python!
